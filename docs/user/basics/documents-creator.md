### Document settings

Each document needs to have a Document title and can have a description.

### Chapters

#### Sections

To fill a chapter with data you can choose from a list of sections:

* `Object details`
* `Text`
* `Headline`
* `Custom Table`

The `Headline` is added by default. In the `Text` section you can use supported [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to build high quality documents. Also sections can be reordered or deleted.

### Mailings

Each entry needs a title, recipient(s) which can also be added by direct input, a subject and a message.
After that you can set a execution date and configure if the mailing should be done in an interval.
When you check `Repeat execution` you can select a `End date of execution` and an interval.

When the configuration is done you see the mailing list with all configured mailings.
Here you can alter a mailing, pause the mailing or check the `Logs of execution` for errors.
