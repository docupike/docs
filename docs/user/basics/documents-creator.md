# Documents Creator

The Documents creator converts your documentation data into user-friendly documents. This allows you to reach a diverse audience - from tech-savvy stakeholders to the less digitally fluent decision-makers.

The documents can serve as a documentation basis for audits, conformity checks and customer reporting. Documents are available in the main navigation bar.

## Rights

You should check the [Rights](../../admin/rights-and-permissions.md) and alter them to fit your needs. It is also possible to set `All available Rights (inlcuding future updates)`.

## Design your documents

One size doesn't fit all, especially in the world of IT Asset Management. Different stakeholders have different needs. Customize your document with different chapters and sections and decide what elements of your IT asset data take center stage.

### Global documents

### Tenant documents

Tenant documents are only available for the current tenant.

### Document settings

Each document needs to have a Document title and can have a description.

### Chapters

#### Sections

To fill the Chapter with data you have to Option to add `Object details` section, `Text` section, `Headline` section and a `Custom Table`. The `Headline` is added by default.

### Sending documents to the target group

Accelerate your communication: Instead of manually crafting and distributing documents, you can use automated mailings to swiftly and regularly compile the latest and most relevant information and send it to your audience.

### Mailings

Each mailing list needs a title, recipient(s) which can also be added by direct input, a subject and a message.
After that you can set a execution date and configure if the mailing should be done in an interval.
When you check `Repeat execution` you can select a `End date of execution` and a interval.

When the configuration is done you see the mailing list with all configured mailings.
Here you can alter a mailing, pause the mailing or check the `Logs of execution` for errors.
