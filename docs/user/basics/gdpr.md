# GDPR / Data protection

An organization, e.g. "Synetics GmbH", can have one or more `Information Security Domain` classes. A `Information Security Domain` is used to map different processing activities, like Marketing E-Mails for the Market department.

Risks and measures need to be documented, too. Measures for the risks can then be stored in the organization. In addition, the status of the implementation of measures and a review can be viewed.

## Quick guide

All [Classes](../basics/classes.md) that belong to `Data protection` are stored in the data protection [Collection](../basics/collections.md) which can be found in the [Finder](collections.md) menu.

Your first step is to create a `Organization` class like "Synetics GmbH". Also you may create one or more `Information Security Domain` classes like "Human resources ISD" or "Market ISD".
Now use the `Inventory > Finder > Data protection` view to create all needed classes.

Begin with documenting your processes and necessary categories like `Processing`, `Processing data`, `Processors` and `Risk management (CIA)`.
While documenting this data you will step over the Class `Data Transmission` where you document the categories `Data transmission`.
The next step could be documenting a existing `Data processing agreement` by adding the information to the `Contract` class.
Now we can document the `Threats` and the `Measures (tech/org)`.

After that the `Processing activities`, `Implemented measures`, `Reviews of implemented measures` and the `Risk management (CIA)` categories can be viewed or edited in the organization class.

At the end you can open the add-on via [Add-ons] menu and export the created PDF file.
