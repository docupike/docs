# GDPR / Data protection

An organization, e.g. Synetics, can have several information security domains.
ISDs are used to map different processes. E.g. care or market processes.
Risks and measures are documented.

Measures for the risks can then be stored in the organization.
In addition, the status of the implementation of measures and a review.

## Quick guide

All [classes](../basics/classes.md) that belong to `data protection` are stored in the data protection [collection](../basics/collections.md) which can be found in the [finder](collections.md) menu.
Your first step is to create a organization object.
Now you document your processes and necessary categories like `Processing`, `Processing data`, `Processors` and `Risk management (CIA)`.
While documenting this data you will step over the Class `Data Transmission` where you document the categories `Data transmission`.
The next step could be documenting a existing `Data processing agreement` by adding the information to the `Contract` class.
Now we can document the `Threats` and the `Measures (tech/org)`.

After that the `Processing activities`, `Implemented measures`, `Reviews of implemented measures` and the `Risk management (CIA)` categories can be viewed or edited in the organization class.

At the end you can open the add-on via [Add-ons] menu and export the PDF.
