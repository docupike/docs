# Categories and attributes

Attributes are the smallest entity of the documentation. They are identifiers that help to structure the documentation. An attribute (such as `Serial number`) can have one or more values. Attributes come in different field types that allow to store different sets of information. Depending on the field type there can be certain restrictions that come along with an attribute. The attribute `IP address` for example has strict formatting rules.

Categories are containers for attributes. They bundle the information that belongs together in terms of content. For example, the accounting category compiles all attributes that belong to the accounting topics such as cost center or date of acquisition.

docupike ships with lots of predefined categories and attributes but you can still create your own categories and attributes if there is something missing for you.
