# Search filters and reports

The main search bar in the `Finder` is the easiest way to search for information. If you simply enter text into the bar and press enter, a full text search is being executed. Before you press enter, a suggestion search window opens up which provides you links to recent searches. Results are shown [in the `Finder` table](views-and-presets.md).

On the right side of the search bar is a filter button which allows you to search for values of selected attributes. You can navigate through all available attributes and specify a search condition for each selected attribute.

All filter and search terms are shown as filter bubbles in the search bar, so you can narrow your search down or change certain parts of your search.

Your searches can be saved for future re-use. This can be useful either if you use a specific search query very often or if you want to have a standardized report that you use to export data on a regular basis.
