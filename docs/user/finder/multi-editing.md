# Multi editing

If you select multiple objects in the `Finder` and press the edit button, you change the context from the `Finder` to the multi editing tool. The multi editing tool allows you to simultaneously edit all categories in all objects that you selected. This comes in handy when you need to change multiple values at once or compare and change values for multiple objects.

Unsaved changes in different categories are marked with a blue dot next to the category name. Changes will only be applied when you press the save button.
