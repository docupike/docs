## Multi editing

When you select multiple objects in the Finder and click the Edit button, you switch from the Finder to the Multi-edit tool. The multi-edit tool allows you to edit all the categories in all the objects you select on one page. This is especially handy when you want to change multiple values at once or compare and change values for multiple objects.

Unsaved changes in different categories are marked with a green frame around the attribute field. The changes are not applied until you click the "Save" button. If you want to leave the Multi Edit mode you can use the Save and Close button and get back to your object list.
