# Documents Creator

The Documents creator converts your documentation data into user-friendly documents. This allows you to reach a diverse audience - from tech-savvy stakeholders to the less digitally fluent decision-makers.

The documents can serve as a documentation basis for audits, conformity checks and customer reporting. Documents are available in the main navigation bar.

### Design your documents

One size doesn't fit all, especially in the world of IT Asset Management. Different stakeholders have different needs. Customize your document with different chapters and sections and decide what elements of your IT asset data take center stage.

### Send documents to audience

Accelerate your communication: Instead of manually crafting and distributing documents, you can use automated mailings to swiftly and regularly compile the latest and most relevant information and send it to your audience.
