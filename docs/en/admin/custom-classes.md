# Custom Classes
Classes in i-doit up are the basis of your it documentation. i-doit up is delivered with a number of predefined classes, which should help you to get started quickly with it documentation.

# Add Custom Classes
But we give you the possibility to define your own classes.

After that the new class is available and can be used.

# Customizing Custom Classes
Under `Settings > CMDB Configuration > Classes > New class name` you can make further adjustments to the created class:

`Title`
Here you can change the name of the class

`Icon`
Here you can select another icon for the class

`Location Class`
