# Search and filter

The main search bar in Finder is the easiest way to search for information. Simply enter text in the bar and press Enter to perform a full-text search. Before you press Enter, a window with search suggestions will open, showing you links to recent searches.

To the right of the search bar is a **filter** button that allows you to search for values of selected attributes. You can navigate through all available attributes and set a search condition for each selected attribute.

All **filters** are displayed as "filter bubbles" in the search bar, allowing you to narrow your search or change specific parts of your search.

Your **search queries** can be saved for later reuse. This can be useful if you use a particular search query very frequently.
