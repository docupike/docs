# Classes

Object classes are the base frameworks of your it-documentation.

They serve two purposes:

1.  Give the user a recognizable identifier (such as `Server` or `Room`)
2.  Define which categories belong to the class

!!! info "Example"

    Use the object class `Person` to document address data, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.

Since you can extend and adjust the documentation to your needs, an object class can be whatever you define it to be. But i-doit up for sure comes with a standard set of object classes that is suited to fit most users' needs.
