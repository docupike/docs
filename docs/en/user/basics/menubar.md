## Inventory

The Inventory displays functions. Using the [**Finder**](../finder/search-filters-and-reports.md), you can select from your [collections](collections.md), which display all the objects you have defined in your collections. The [**Locations**](../usecases/locations.md) show all documented location objects and objects assigned to a location. The [Networks] overview shows all networks and how their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used. The [**Data Protection Add-on**](../usecases/data-protection.md) is also located here.

## Reporting

The reports area is where you can create and see all [**reports**](../reporting.md) or [**documents**](../documents-creator.md).

## History

The history shows you the [**History**](objects.md#history) of your latest changes. By opening the complete history view, you can filter by type, creator and category.

## Help

In this menu, you can view the integrated [Explore guide] or access the Documentation.

## Density Mode

The density mode is used to change the spacing of the user interface. You can choose between two modes: Compact and Comfortable.

## Settings

By pressing on your profile picture, you can open the [Settings], give feedback, access the [Add-on administration] or [Logout]. This is where you can configure everything about the [**classes**](classes.md) and [**categories**](categories-and-attributes.md) but also manage your users and administrate [billing] and [subscription].
