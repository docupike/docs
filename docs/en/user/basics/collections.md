# Collections

Collections are compilations of object classes. They are defined by the administrator of the system, but i-doit up ships with a predefined set of collections. Their benefit is to put classes into categories that are easier to find for the user.

Classes appear directly under the `Finder` menu in the toolbar and every user is able to individually hide classes that are not often used. They are still available to the user via the `more` button on the bottom of the class dialog.

In the `Finder` drop-down menu you can not only find standard collections types, but also two special kinds of collections: `Favorites` and `All classes`. `Favorites` contains those classes that the user pins with a "favorite star". The collection `All classes` always show all classes which are enabled.
