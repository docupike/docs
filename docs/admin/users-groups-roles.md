# Users, groups and roles

Users, groups and Roles can be managed in the `Settings`. Groups and Roles are containers for users and can be used to organize your [rights and permissions](rights-and-permissions.md). Technically spoken, groups and roles work the same way and can also be used in combination.

i-doit is shipped with two pre-defined roles: `admin` and `user`. While the `admin` role has all rights and permissions, the `user` role has no rights at all but all permissions.

## Set or change user password

When you create a new user or if you want to change the password of an existing user, you can do so in the `settings>user` section of i-doit.

At `Security` you can set a new password, linked to that user. This needs to be typed twice for verification purposes. The password must have at least 8 characters (max. 64), and must contain at least one number and a mix of upper- and lowercase letters. Add special characters for an even stronger password.
