# Attribute order customization

You are able to customise the order of the Attributes under Categories so that all users in your organisation see first the most relevant attributes to your work. Also the attributes appear everywhere (object details, Finder, Favorites etc.) in the same order.

## Requirements

You need to have the [right to `Manage Categories`](rights-and-permissions.md) set to use the function.

## Customize the attribute order

Go to `Settings > CMDB Configuration > Categories`, select a category and click `Manage attributes` button to manage Attribute order.
Now you can drag and drop the attribute to the desired position in the category.
