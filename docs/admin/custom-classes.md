# custom classes  
Classes in i-doit are the basis of your it documentation. i-doit is delivered with a number of predefined classes, which should help you to get started quickly with it documentation.

# add custom classes
But of course we give you the possibility to define your own classes.
Go to `Settings>CMDB Configuration>Classes` and click on the New Class button.
In the mask that opens, you can now enter a name for the new class and confirm with Save.
After that the new class is available and can be used.

# customizing custom classes
Under `Settings>CMDB Configuration>Classes>New class name` you can make further adjustments to the just created class:

`Title`  
Here you can change the name of the class

`Icon`  
Here you can select another icon for the class

`Location Class`  
Here you can change the class to a location class. This way objects of this class type become locations and can be used in the location tree.

`Containing categories`  
Here you can further define the class and add categories to this class.
