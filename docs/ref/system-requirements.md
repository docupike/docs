# System requirements

For the best user experience please ensure all your clients meet docupike's software requirements.

## Supported Web browsers

docupike is a typical modern Web application. Therefore, you need a Web browser on all clients.

Common requirements:

-   JavaScript and Cookies _must_ be enabled.
-   All modern Web browsers _should_ work.
-   Desktop variants of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are actively supported (current version and latest long-term supported version).
-   The more information you like to see at the same time the higher the display resolution should be. Something around full HD (`1920x1080`) is optimal.
-   Operating platform does not matter.
